# Seattle Aerospace Graph


  This was a fun challenge particularly because the data itself left so many questions to be answered -- without knowing more about the particular archetypes of industry being represented, I was able to make the legibility of the relationships my primary consideration.  
  A graph was a fairly logical choice.  Because there were a relatively large number of relationships to display, I settled on grouping every node with its 'parented' edges, and an additional set of color-coded labels for its end-nodes, and then controlling the visibility of this group based on hovering on the node. This way, a user could explore each node individually, and have the clearest picture of what each industry related to. The activities and objects, I grouped into general categories, and represented them with the border and fill of each node, so that it would be easy to see the commonalities across the entire
industry network. On a second pass, I would probably experiment with refactoring this into a force-directed graph, aiming to represent these attributes exclusviely through their placement and grouping with other nodes. This would have the added
advantage of making it easier to represent all of the relationships as a group while still maintaining their readability.
